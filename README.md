# restaurant-manager
Graphical Java program created to manage a real restaurant

The code is written using the Object Oriented Java and Java Swing.
You can also save and load via files the restaurant status. I Recommend NetBeans 11.1, which I used during the development. 
You can also find a report on the program (in Italian) and all its design phase.

Enjoy! I hope you'll find the code well-written and the program interesting! 
If you need help or you only want to know something more about me or the code, contact me!

This program can be used completely free for learning purposes
